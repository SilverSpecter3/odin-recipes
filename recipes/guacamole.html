        <h2>Guacamole a la Chipotle Mexican Grill</h2>
        <p>This recipe is how we used to make it back when I worked at Chipotle in 2012-2013. Maybe things have changed since then, but it still a simple and delicious. I guarantee* it will be the highlight of a meal with friends and family! </p>
        <p>One thing to note is we made large batches of guacamole with a case of avocados as a starting point. I have scaled the ingredients to what I remember it tasting like.</p>
        <p>*<sub>I guarantee you didn't make it right if it was not a hit.</sub></p>
