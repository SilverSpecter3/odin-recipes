        <h2>Guacamole a la Chipotle Mexican Grill</h2>
        <p>This recipe is how we used to make it back when I worked at Chipotle in 2012-2013. Maybe things have changed since then, but it still a simple and delicious. I guarantee* it will be the highlight of a meal with friends and family! </p>
        <p>One thing to note is we made large batches of guacamole with a case of avocados as a starting point. I have scaled the ingredients to what I remember it tasting like. My wife doesn't red onion, but she doesn't mind it in the guacamole. Try it before swapping it and don't remove it entirely. The onion also makes adds a lot of volume to the guacamole. More guac = more happy.</p>
        <p>*<sub>I guarantee you didn't make it right if it was not a hit.</sub></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Hass avocados</li>
            <li>1/2 large red onion - diced</li>
            <li>1 jalepeño (I like to substitute a serrano pepper. Its a spicier pepper but not noticeable in the guacamole.)</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of lime juice</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/8 cup of chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt (add more to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the avocado longitudinally, remove the pit, and scoop out the flesh from the skin...well that turned dark really quick.</li>
            <li>Add the citrus juices and salt. It helps soften the avocado a bit in case you just went to the store last minute and bought the avocados. Nice work planning ahead of time. </li>
            <li>Begin mashing he avocado to a creamy consistency. I prefer to call it a gooey texure, but I don't think people like that word to describe food.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, jalepeño, and cilantro and give it a mix to distribute it evenly.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Yea, so that is it. Be sure to leave a like and subscribe. Isn't that annoying how often you hear that? Like I just needed to look up one thing. Why would I subscribe? You had a clickbaity thumbnail. Why do you look so surprised in the thumbnail. You weren't surprised the entire video. Do you really want Google to see that I subscribed to your channel and never watch? They will probably end up thinking your content it bad now and not recommend it on people's feed. You brough this upon yourself, you turd nugget.</p>
