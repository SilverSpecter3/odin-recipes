        <h1>Dry Ass Biscuits</h1>
        <img src="../images/biscuits.webp" alt="sheet pan of moist, layered biscuits">
        <p>This is my plant-based spin on <a href="https://altonbrown.com/recipes/southern-buttermilk-biscuits/>">Alton Brown's southern style buttermilk biscuits.</a> It has the ingredient measurements in both meteric and U.S. standard. I lowered the temperature and and reduced the cooking time because making the original recipe made some crispy, crunchy,hard biscuits. Perhaps it has to do with the vegan substitutes of some of the ingredients. I am sure the original recipe, when properly adhered to, produced excellent biscuits.</p>
        <p>My recipe does not actually yield dry ass biscuits. That is just a fun title. I thought it would get a good laugh. I am disappointed by the biscuits in that they don't taste like buttery biscuits you get from Cracker Barrell. I don't know if Cracker Barrell biscuits are considered "good" by the masses, but I think they are very tasty. If you can think of another really good one biscuit for me to try, let me know in the comments below. Kidding, there is no comments section. Pray that I discover what you would have recommended I suppose.</p>
