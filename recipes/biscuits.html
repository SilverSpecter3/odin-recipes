        <h1>Dry Ass Biscuits</h1>
        <img src="../images/biscuits.webp" alt="sheet pan of moist, layered biscuits">
        <p>This is my plant-based spin on <a href="https://altonbrown.com/recipes/southern-buttermilk-biscuits/>">Alton Brown's southern style buttermilk biscuits.</a> It has the ingredient measurements in both meteric and U.S. standard. I lowered the temperature and and reduced the cooking time because making the original recipe made some crispy, crunchy,hard biscuits. Perhaps it has to do with the vegan substitutes of some of the ingredients. I am sure the original recipe, when properly adhered to, produced excellent biscuits.</p>
        <p>My recipe does not actually yield dry ass biscuits. That is just a fun title. I thought it would get a good laugh. I am disappointed by the biscuits in that they don't taste like buttery biscuits you get from Cracker Barrell. I don't know if Cracker Barrell biscuits are considered "good" by the masses, but I think they are very tasty. If you can think of another really good one biscuit for me to try, let me know in the comments below. Kidding, there is no comments section. Pray that I discover what you would have recommended I suppose.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>340 grams (12 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus an additional half cup for dusting</li>
            <li>1 cup vegan buttermilk (see step 1), chilled</li>
            <li>20 grams (4 teaspoons) baking powder</li>
            <li>1 gram (1/4 teaspoon) baking soda</li>
            <li>2 grams (3/4 teaspoon) kosher salt</li>
            <li>60 grams (2.1 ounces) vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>30 grams (1 ounce) unsalted dairy-free butter, sliced into very thin pats and chilled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix 1 cup of plain, unsweetened plant-based milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Half a lemon should get you a bit over a tablespoon. Let them hang out for a bit and get to know each other in the fridge while you get you get your other ingredients ready and take it out once you get to step 4.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 400ºF.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Working quickly (so the fats don't melt), use your fingertips to rub the shortening and butter into the dry mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the dry mixture and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It should be wet, clumpy, and very sticky. While it’s still in the bowl, fold the dough over on itself two times so that it picks up any remaining flour, and then turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. </li>
            <li>Dust the top of the dough with flour and, with floured hands, gently fold the dough over itself (like closing an open book) 8 more times, turning one quarter turn between each folding motion. If you have a bench scraper, I would use it for the folding as it lets you get under the dough easily. Press dough into a 1-inch-thick round. Cut out biscuits with a floured 2 1/2-inch cutter, being sure to press straight down through the dough without twisting. Flour the cutter between cuts.</li>
            <li>Center biscuits on a baking sheet, shoulder to shoulder, so that they just touch. Reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible, and continue cutting until you have around 12 biscuits total.</li>
            <li>Bake on center rack for 8 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees in the oven and continue baking until tall and lightly gold on top, 8-10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove to a clean tea or kitchen towel set in a bowl and fold towel over to preserve warmth and steam.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Okay you are ready to enjoy. If you are bad at reading directions you can watch the biscuits episode of Good Eats: Reloaded to watch Alton do it.Just make sure you reduce the temparture to 400ºF and reduce time to 16 total minutes. If you don't, you will get some Ford-tough biscuits.</p>
