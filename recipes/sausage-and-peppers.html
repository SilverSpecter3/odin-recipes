        <h1>Sausage &amp; Mother****ing Peppers</h1>
        <img src="../images/sausage-and-peppers.jpeg" alt="pan full of delectable sausage, peppers, and onions in a vivid tomato sause">
        <p>This is a really good recipe for sausage and peppers based on <a href="https://spicysouthernkitchen.com/italian-sausage-peppers/">one I found online</a> a few years ago. I haven't eaten meat in a while, but you can just sub out he plant-based sausages with any kind you like. That said, I highly recommend trying the Beyond Meat sausages links. As a former heavy meat eater, I can say they taste very authentic. Probably the most authentic tasting plant-based meat alternative I have ever had.</p>
        <p>Now to anyone wondering why would I eat a vegan sausage if I gave up meat years ago. Well, you little shit, flavor is not one of the common reasons people giveup animal products. Also, I have never seen an animal in the shape of a sausage link or a burger patty so go kick rocks if you don't like the alternatives that exist now.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon of your favorite high heat oil</li>
            <li>1 package Beyond Meat Sweet Italian or Hot Italian Sausage (not really spicy at all). Even Brat Original would work fine.</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, batonnet cut</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, batonnet cut</li>
            <li>2 sweet onions, batonnet cut</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes or dice some fresh tomatoes yourself you lazy heifer. Roma/plum and Ugly Ripe tomatoes work really well with this. The name of the tomato is acutally called Ugly Ripe. It's what's on the inside that counts.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add vegetable oil to a large pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add sausages and cook until browned on all sides. Remove sausage from pan and set aside (Note: You do not need to cook it through at this point.)</li>
            <li>Add onion and peppers to grease left in pan and cook over medium heat until softened. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Slice sausage into 1 to 1 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Return sausage to pan along with all other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until sausage is cooked through and sauce is thickened.</li>
            <li>Serve on hoagie rolls, over la pasta, or on it's own with whatever sides you like.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Welp, there you go. Enjoy. I think I will make some tomorrow.</p>
