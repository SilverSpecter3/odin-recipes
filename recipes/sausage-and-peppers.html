        <p>This is a really good recipe for sausage and peppers based on <a href="https://spicysouthernkitchen.com/italian-sausage-peppers/">one I found online</a> a few years ago. I haven't eaten meat in a while, but you can just sub out he plant-based sausages with any kind you like. That said, I highly recommend trying the Beyond Meat sausages links. As a former heavy meat eater, I can say they taste very authentic. Probably the most authentic tasting plant-based meat alternative I have ever had.</p>
        <p>Now to anyone wondering why would I eat a vegan sausage if I gave up meat years ago. Well, you little shit, flavor is not one of the common reasons people giveup animal products. Also, I have never seen an animal in the shape of a sausage link or a burger patty so go kick rocks if you don't like the alternatives that exist now.</p>
